# UdaciCards Project

UdaciCards is a mobile application built with react-native that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app  allows users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

The application works on both Ios and android `(Although I have only tested it on android)`

Built with: `Expo, React-native`
